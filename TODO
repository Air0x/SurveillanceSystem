Needed information for contributors:
====================================

Packet structure:
Client(C), Server(S).

DEMO:
====================================

[1 byte OpCode]|[?? bytes computer name in bytes]

For instance:
[0x00][0x41,0x41] C -> S. This is basicaly a Heartbeat(online-check) sent from computer AA to the server to tell it's online.
Just one-way communication right now.

Demo of website visited C -> S.
[0x03][0x41,0x41][0x68,0x74,0x74,0x70.......]
0x03 is the OpCode for telling the server its sending a URL/website. 

=======================================

TODO:

*Instead of letting the client send the heartbeat to the server let the server send to the client and wait for reply.
So [0x00][each computer named saved in a list], if no reply the teacher get a notice on her pc.

*Fix the recv buffer in the: "SkolanProjektServer / SkolanProjekt / Network_Classes / TCP_Globals.cs".
right now its 1024 bytes just too make sure all the packets fit in nice. *JUST let the buffer get the size needed for info*

*Calculate the minimum and maximum size of the computer name possible to recv,
min and max characters the computer name can have.

*Get the computer name in the client to be able to send it to the server on establishment of the connection.
